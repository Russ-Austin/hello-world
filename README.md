# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Russ Austin.  I have been in IT for many years, but I had a long break when I did not.  Now, I am playing some catch up but am gratefully achieving most of my goals.  I hope to be versitile in C, CAD, Linux System-Admin, Web development, and my Faith - but not in that order.  You judge for yourself which I hold highest - smile.
